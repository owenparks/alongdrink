Feedback: A Long Drink
Writing is not too fluid, and lacks the emotion and urgentness of a murder happening
right in front of you.

A fairly ambitious game, but lots of implementation issues. It's playable to completion, but I think I
missed a certain amount of conversation choices (e.g. I couldn't talk to Nathaniel or Scott at all). Also it
didn't really feel like I solved a mystery, more like I explored some convo trees and did what I was told to
do.
-
the triggers were often hard to find and NPCs didn't
respond to things that seemed pretty major.
-
the work is just
woefully underimplemented. My wrist is sore, but I can't examine my wrist, for example. Val refers to the
mountain and to a friend of hers, but I can't ask her about either. Liquid isn't implemented. Cardigan isn't
implemented. I could go on and on, but you get my point. I am the kind of player who likes to examine
everything, so I felt very thwarted! I was most frustrated in the scene where I went back to the car and I'm
instructed to examine everything, but nothing I tried to examine was implemented.
-

- then val driving I hit a blockshe doesn’t respond, car not implemented

- I’m supposed to “wait”I don’t know what’s happening, prompted to ask about “my file” and now I can’t.

- “We stood at end of driveway” but Val is not there? The house is not something I could enter. waiting doesn’t work now.I’m having to lead val to where I don’t know. She should be prompting me since I was asked to follow her.

- Puddle, Art, chinese art, court scene and persian rug not implemented but specified in description.

- I’m to keep going east, but this is not prompted, and not listed as an exit.

- I try to leave, the car we just drove here in has disappeared.

- SMELL STAIN should make clear if it’s blood or wine.

- Remove I beg your pardon error message 

- ”Description for reading nook always starts with “I climbed the stairs to the reading nook” even though I’ve been there examining
things.

- Dicey grammar: I heard the front door open, and the sound of voices from the foyer. It closed a
minute later.(the door or the voices?)
- Val and I glanced at each other across the dead man, and she left
back down the stairs.(left is ambiguous for “exited”)

- Press Any Key this time just gets me a bare prompt,
shouldn’t something happen? Three random new characters who stand there waiting for me to direct the
narrative.

- Scott’s description starts with “Scott Gage, on the other hand,...” whether I examine him first or
not.

- I’m going east...I have to leave for them to start conversing?  What about when I enter?

- Why do I have a solid alibi? Don’t ever use “press any key” without anything happening...that should be like a fade out
in a movie where something interesting happens next.

- “I walked into the spacious foyer, trying not to walk into the ...” watch repeated words.Oh god there’s a few hours of this?What circle val????
- Threaded conversation problems
- This sentence is kind of awful: “She gave me a sharp look. I could tell it got a lot of use, it was just as practiced as everything else about her. Here was a woman who wasn’t afraid to throw her weight around, and made it a bad habit to force her to do it.”She
hired me and now the house is locked down?
- I can ask about nathaniel and alan, but
jan isn’t a topic.
- East from greatroom is an undescribed exit.
- “I was starting to feel tired. Everything that had happened in the past few days was finally starting to
take its toll. I thought it might help to find a bedroom and sleep for a few hours.” over and over.
- paintings on walls not implemented.Ignoring that, I get a computer which is done with a Menu extension
- Some emails say “stuff” like it’s a placeholder.“Urgent Request” sent email won’t open with no explanation
- Can’t ask val about bedroom, cannot find a bedroom. quit.

- "unbuckle" worked, but "unbuckle seatbelt" didn't, which confused me for a while. I liked the interaction
with the computer, and that you included background emails that you would expect the character to
actually have received. 
- Also the detail with the box at the bottom of the stairs was nice.
-
I encountered a lot of bugs and odd implementation issues such as LOOK descriptions of rooms retaining
"As you enter..." text and unimplemented objects. It's hard to evaluate the base story due to this, but
checking the search history autocomplete was a great touch.
-
- I never figured out who Val is to me, how I became a vampire, what Alan's secret was, etc. 
- Was Alan a vampire too?
- I tried to "follow Val" into the chalet and I ended up with the
following:> follow valWhat would I like to discuss: about Val, about questioning Val or about my file?>
discuss valThat doesn’t seem to be a topic of conversation at the moment.> discuss about valWhat would
I like to discuss: about Val, about questioning Val or about my file?I feel like I have a lot of questions for
Val and that it would've been appropriate to tell her about my accident, but I don't appear to have any
options to do that.
- Can’t sit on sofa.
- Do I know these people already? I know their full names though it
seems like this is the first time I’ve met them.
- Master bedroom mentions bed in great detail but it doesn't appear to be implemented.
- Bank statement still shows up in Library after it is taken.
- I can take fuse box and carry it around.
- Can't see Scott's body. 
- Val disappears after fight without warning.

Fair warning: I didn't complete this game. The unclued exits make searching around for navigation pretty

tedious, and it's obviously incomplete. Some rooms had no description, there is narrative text missing,
synonyms aren't hacked out very well and the game doesn't credit the player's creativity. These are all
polish problems, not fatal ones, but it definitely makes the game frustrating to play. The prose is pretty
strong, with a nice hard-boiled vibe. I really like the past-tense descriptions which made it sound like a
story being told to someone. But, there's no real context for what happens, and the characters are
curiously dispassionate. (e.g. Val shows zero emotion that your character nearly died in the opening
scenes.)I've described some problems I found below.Bugs/Issues:- Often I'd have to "(press a key)" to
continue after a paragraph, only to have the game drop me right to a command prompt. No need to pause
after exposition when there's nothing more to say.- Many objects were described, but couldn't be
examined. - The shutters closed on the house with no explanation. Who did that? Why was it possible?-
Room descriptions (e.g. The Foyer) start with "You walked into..." Doesn't work if I've been standing in
the room for awhile and then decide to refresh my memory of my surroundings. - Exits are almost never
signalled in room descriptions or otherwise. How do I know where I can go?- The Dec 18 e-mail from
payroll just said "Stuff"- Email to Val didn't appear on a new page- The computer doesn't remain on after
using it- The autocomplete mechanic is too heavily clued, and too lightly implemented.- Several room
descriptions are incomplete.- When I found the bedroom and slept, the text assumed an event that was
never described: that Val was either sleeping in the bed already or had come in at some point.- Adrian
shows up with no fanfare, no rousting or introduction. No title (until you examine him.)

Vampire detective is a pretty cool idea, but unfortunately the game's implementation didn't do it any
favors. Although there were topics listed for NPC dialog (which is very much appreciated), actually using
them was sometimes a challenge, because what you typed had to match what was on the screen pretty
exactly (or in some cases, I had to guess what the right translation was). There were a great many
unimplemented objects, which progressively weakened my confidence in the game overall. Searching the
car was a real guessing game. And exits weren't listed in the room descriptions (although I am glad you
added an EXITS command to help compensate).I also saw a few outright bugs: 1) Scott supposedly being
in an upstairs bedroom, only I couldn't interact with him at all (privately-named something else,
perhaps?); 2) a key item in the sent-mail folder was unopenable; 3) Scott's body at the end being
impossible to interact with (I saw the walkthru later with the note about scott_body, so obviously you
know about this).Anyway, I think this was a pretty decent effort with a clever idea at its heart. I would
recommend getting much more thorough testing. Experienced IF players will be able to very rapidly tell
you where your implementation falls short.

This started out as a really ambitious, intriguing game. First person/past tense is an interesting decision
here - helps with the hardbitten detective tone that opens the story. May be a touch cliched but I was
drawn in immediately. Amused by "I was not a professional driver, nor was this a closed course...." The
writing across the board is very good.However, the further I got into the game, the less well-implemented
it became - no description at all for one of the bedrooms, minimally implemented kitchen, minimal
implementation in other bedrooms, etc. Many things I wanted to try - such as giving the cash or photos to
Adrian - received no response at all. Nathaniel and Jan were minimally implemented in their bedrooms,
and I was unable at all to interact with Scott in the Sumac Room. I loved where you started with this game
and it was disappointing to grind to a halt. Please do a post-competition release!

I was mostly able to brute-force this game. That's good, because it was generally pretty helpful and
roughly helped me with what to do, but bad because, well, I needed to. The hints were nice and not too
obvious. So I think you have a good sense of balance and pacing.The 2 for the puzzles is due to it being
hard to find what part of the car to search to determine it was sabotaged. Otherwise there's a lot to like
here.The writing was fun and probably 3+ so though I didn't give any 4's, I think my 3's were generally
closer to 4 than 2. While noir has been a bit played out, I still like how this gave a big enough world but
not too big you were lost. The one big problem I'd fix is unresponsive PCs in the east wing.
