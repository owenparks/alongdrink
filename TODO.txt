- Tentative organization:
    - Character directory
        - PC description
        - NPC behavior/movement/descriptions
    - Scene
        - Scene begins/ends logic, done as a sort of preamble/postamble contract
        - Part of this should be changing the description or behavior of existing characters
            - Optionally, every scene could simply use a new NPC character object
        - Every scene should make explicit its assumptions about game state, if any
        - NPC conversation for that scene.
