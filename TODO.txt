- Change the room to upturned_car
- Change the scene
- Rework the "stop" and "brake" verbs, simplify to any command translating to go down.
- Remove the room entirely with the scene change, change geography to prevent player escape?

- Test making sure the player cannot leave while in a room

- Debugging command to get the location of the player

- Tentative organization:
    - Character directory
        - PC description
        - NPC behavior/movement/descriptions
    - Scene
        - Scene begins/ends logic, done as a sort of preamble/postamble contract
        - Part of this should be changing the description or behavior of existing characters
            - Optionally, every scene could simply use a new NPC character object
        - Every scene should make explicit its assumptions about game state, if any
        - NPC conversation for that scene.

============

- I woke up and realized I didn't need a shave. I'd probably never need a shave again. I half considered going through the motions anyway, but gave upon the idea as stupid.
