The story description is "The first time I'd met Val was the day before yesterday, on my way out of the hospital. I'd been in a numb stupor for hours. There's no good way to take that kind of news.  She'd asked me out for a drink. I remember thinking there was something Old Hollywood glam about her, like Veronica Lake or Lauren Bacall. I figured she was trouble, but I had nothing to lose, and she looked like my kind of trouble. Turns out I didn't know the half of it.

Daybreak was just a few hours away. I stared at the crumpled remains of my car, and beyond to the frozen lake below. I wondered if I'd ever see her again.".

[ I don't think I'll be using Exit Listing for the moment
This is the custom exit listing rule:
	let exits be the number of exit-listable directions;
	if exits is 0, say "[We] [can see] no obvious exits." (A);
	otherwise say "[list of exit-listable directions]." (B).

The custom exit listing rule substitutes for the standard exit listing rule.
